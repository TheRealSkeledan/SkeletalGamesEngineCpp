# Skeletal Games Engine (C++ EDITION)
The C++ version of Skeletal Games Engine, designed to give a good start to people who want to make a C++-based game

## Why choose?

* Includes a C++ compiler along with it to compile the source code into a runnable EXE. Currently will only compile for Windows

* It is planned that in the future, there'll will be more customisation options and pre-coded varities, such as loading screens, menus, and more!

* You're not limited to anything! You can code everything in C++ and change whatever you need for better development

## What games can I make?
* You can make various 2D games, such as RPGs or fighter games

* The base games currently is a basic fighting game

## Is C++ the only language I can use?
